My name is John Gary, BSN, RN and I am interested in becoming a data analyst, specifically on the clinical healthcare or clinical research fields.
I have one year's experience of neurosurgical progressive care floor nursing, one year's experience as an ICU Nurse at The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN during the pandemic and was forunate enough to work alongside Mayo's R&D department. This piqued my interest in clinical research and became my niche/area of healthcare I found most interesting.
I then spent a year at the Dallas VA Hospital as a Clinical Research Nurse involved with cardiac, endorcine, oncology and nuclear medicine clinical trials gaing much experience in ICH-GCP guidelines, IRB submissals, patient recruitment and FDA CFR's.
I have spent the past two years working at IQVIA as a Site Research Assistant/Clinical Research Coordinator.
Altogether I have 4 years' experience working in the clinical research field. In addition to data analyst roles I am seeking Clinical Research Associate roles, in-house CRA roles, associate CRA roles as well as any CRA roles offered via a pharmaceutical sponsor's or contract research organization's training program, if accepted.

I have completed Parexel Academy's post-grad certificate program in Clinical Trial Monitoring and am knowledgeable of both US and EU regulations. I have currently completed both SQL and Python certification programs offered by the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. I am currently enrolled in the MS powerBI program and am anticipated to complete that program by the end of April 2025.
In January 2025 I began graduate school at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics. I am seeking an MS in Biomedical Informatics and am estimated to complete the program by the summer of 2027. My goal is to develop skills in Health Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and how I can apply my knowledge as an informatician to advances in translational research.

This is my eProject portfolio containing projects that I have completed, both for my own personal practice and for any prospective job opportunities.
Each project and its files are going to be stored in its own unique branch in my repository. Feel free to check them out. If you have any questions please message me on here and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Sincerely,

John Gary, BSN, RN
